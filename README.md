# factorwithpairs!!
i just wanted to have something on my page so here's this terrible thing i did to help with my math homework
# what the heck does it do
it finds factors for a number you inputted and also gives you factor pairs
# why????
because i'm solving quadratic formulas right now and i want my computer to find factors to help solve them, because the numbers can get big and i don't want to take forever on those
# wow this code is very inefficient
i know but i just wanted this thing to work so i can do my math homework
